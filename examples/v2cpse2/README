Bare Metal Programming Tool Kit V2CSPSE2 examples directory

This part of the tree contains code that is used in the 
V2CPSE2 I give at the Hogeschool Utrecht, the Netherlands.
These examples work with either the DB013 board (LPC1114 chip),
or with the win target, or (in most cases) with both.


This directory contains :
   Makefile    : supports 'clean' and 'build' targets
   README      : this file
   libraries   : libraries that are specific for this course

subdirectories - course week 1
   hello       : hello world using hwcpp:io::cout
   lines       : random lines with LCD5510 or windows
   subframes   : demonstrates subframes (windows)
   decorators  : demonstrates some frame decorators
   tee         : demonstrates tee decorator
   week1-make  : starting point for week1 assignment
